## About the Video Course
Magento 2 is not just a next version of Magento 1, it is a completely new framework. It introduces a bunch of new libraries and approaches, more opportunities to implement functionality better. This course covers things that each Magento 2 developer should know and apply in addition to just functionality implementation. The course starts with explaining how to get the most value of automated tests provided by Magento out of the box and how to cover your implementation with an appropriate type of test, to ensure a high level of quality. 
Then youâ€™ll learn about Magento 2 indexers, cache types and cron jobs. Keeping the cache and indexers utilised will ensure high website performance while organising cron jobs and moving some operations to asynchronous can help to improve performance even more.
Finally, the third section of the course is dedicated to migration from Magento 1 covering the usage of code and data migration tools.
